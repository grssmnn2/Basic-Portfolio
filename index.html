					<p>My name is Cecily. I have always been passionate about science and technology, especially involving climate change, animal behavior, and human health. I am excited to combine my interests in multiple areas of science to become a web developer after graduation from Northwestern Coding Boot Camp. </p>
					<br>
					<p>When I'm not sitting in front of my computer, I like to cook spicy food, binge watch Issa Rae's show Insecure, and smother my cat Ansel with all the hugs he loves (hates). </p>
